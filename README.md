# MGAonMGO2
Fully converted models from all MGA maps ported to MGO2.


You can use the file contained in each directory on where to put the file(s). 
Some maps contain many differences, some none, some only lighting etc. 

Any map that is not suffix'd with the letter 'a' is a completely new version of the same map made for MGA exclusively (example: n002b, n003b, n003c, etc.)
